# COVID-19-Simulation

A python script able to create COVID-19 spreading simulations and export them as a video

Unlike other scripts, this one stores the frames of the simulation in a folder "results", creating a video out of them at the end.

The simulation can be altered by modifying the parameters of the function "run simulation" (which must be executed for each frame)
